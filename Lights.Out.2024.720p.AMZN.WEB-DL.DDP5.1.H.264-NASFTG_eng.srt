1
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:49,092
Be advised,
we are in a bad situation

2
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:51,616
that we can't really
get spots on ground.

3
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,879
Jimmy, hey,
we're on the west side,

4
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:56,230
left-hand side of the valley,
approaching one now.

5
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:43,929
Move!

6
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:59,119
Hey, Duff! Ford's been hit.

7
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:00,729
We gotta go back for him.

8
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:04,341
Let's move.

9
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:06,300
Duff, let's go! Come on!

10
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,047
Contact!

11
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:25,232
Let's go. Come on.

12
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:39,159
Hey. You're okay. Look at me.

13
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,378
Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

14
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,728
I need you to breathe.
Breathe.

15
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:47,036
Hey, we don't fucking die.
We don't fucking die.

16
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:24,160
Thanks a lot, brother.

17
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,930
What can I get you, papi?

18
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:56,236
Anything cold.

19
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,942
Yeah, that's right.

20
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:08,248
Go ahead, deal them up.

21
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,252
Fuck me.

22
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:16,952
You got a problem, chief?

23
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:19,302
No, no problem here.

24
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:23,350
I was wondering
if you could get one more in.

25
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,656
You got money, we'd be happy
to take it off you.

26
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,701
What's the buy-in?

27
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:27,745
Two hundred dollars.

28
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,183
What about this?

29
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:39,235
Make room for the stranger,
boys.

30
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,063
He just paid for a place.

31
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:44,327
Two hundred dollars.
Don't spend it all at once.

32
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:09,309
I see you, and I'm all in.

33
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:18,230
Quite a poker face you have,
chief.

34
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,494
Only face I got.

35
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,191
Hmm...

36
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:25,977
Just showed you my ball sack.
What you gonna do?

37
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,544
Heh, I'm a little light.

38
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:30,460
Yeah, you are.

39
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:35,073
The fuck
you think you're doing?

40
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:38,860
I'm winning.

41
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:42,037
Fucking son of a bitch.
You're a fucking cheater.

42
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,255
Give me the watch.

43
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,391
Try and take it,
asshole.

44
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:53,396
I think I'll just
let my boys decide.

45
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,449
Hey!

46
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:07,279
Jesus fucking Christ!

47
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:09,586
You are a bad motherfucker.

48
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,244
I can't kick your ass.

49
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:18,073
I should shoot you
right where you fucking stand.

50
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,379
I'm standing right here.

51
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:24,079
You ain't taking my bike.

52
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:26,081
You can keep
the fucking bike.

53
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:28,562
I'm taking my money
and I'm taking my watch.

54
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:43,054
You fucking guys are pathetic.
Jesus Christ!

55
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:56,938
How you doing?

56
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,174
Fosco.

57
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:19,351
Yeah, that's right.
It's Max. Uh-huh.

58
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,224
Yeah. I'm back in town, baby.

59
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,139
Hey, listen,
let me ask you a question.

60
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:26,446
Still having that,
uh, thing tomorrow?

61
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,013
Uh-huh.

62
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,493
Yeah, I'll be there.

63
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,669
And I'm bringing a friend
with me too.

64
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,565
-Hey.
-Hey.

65
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,133
I know you?

66
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:31,788
No, I, um, just wanted to--

67
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:38,186
All right,
we'll go with the hard sell.

68
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:41,450
All right, look.

69
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:43,800
The name's Max.

70
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,591
I was in the bar last night.
I saw you in action.

71
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:55,725
I gotta tell you, you got some
amazing skills, my friend.

72
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,467
So, look, how about this?

73
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,469
How about you let a brother
buy you breakfast

74
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:01,557
while you hear me out?

75
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:06,606
You know, some eggs, some bacon,
maybe a little chorizo.

76
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:08,651
Listen...

77
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:11,654
if you don't like

78
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,830
what I have to say,
if you're not interested,

79
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:16,441
then, hey,
we can just part ways.

80
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,182
No harm, no foul.

81
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:21,490
Besides, breakfast is the
cheapest meal of the day anyway.

82
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,715
I know you don't know me,
but I know fighters.

83
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:34,329
And that skillset you got there
could be a fucking gold mine...

84
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:37,201
if it were to be exploited
by the right per--

85
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,687
That's a great speech, man.

86
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,168
I got no desire
to be exploited.

87
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:48,735
-Just--
-My country did that.

88
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:06,622
All right,
look, just tell me...

89
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:11,540
how much money
did you make last night?

90
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,541
Enough.

91
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:15,587
Enough for what,
hmm?

92
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:19,722
One, maybe two more nights
in some shitty motel?

93
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:22,377
What if you could make enough
to stay in a decent place for,

94
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,206
I don't know, a month?
Maybe even more.

95
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,904
I would tell you that I'm not
one for laying down roots.

96
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:30,472
There has to be something
that you want, right?

97
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:32,866
Come on.
Something that you need.

98
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,215
Everybody needs
something.

99
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:35,520
I don't need anything, man.

100
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:37,435
Everything I need
is right in that bag.

101
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:42,919
Well I can tell you what you're
not gonna find in that bag.

102
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,529
Enlighten me.

103
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:46,270
An outlet.

104
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:48,664
Yeah.

105
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,970
Uh-huh.

106
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,319
I saw you last night.

107
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,540
More importantly,
I saw that look in your face.

108
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,064
That look in your eyes.

109
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,720
You didn't just wanna
choke that clown out.

110
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,591
You wanted to make sure
he understood

111
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,419
that you had something

112
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:05,812
that you were trying
to prove to the world--

113
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:08,597
Hey, hey, hey. Don't think
that you fucking know me.

114
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,425
-I didn't say that I know you.
-Don't.

115
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:12,340
I didn't say
that I know you.

116
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,777
But I do know
that fucking look.

117
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:19,564
It's the same look
my brother had

118
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,828
when he came home
from Afghanistan.

119
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:25,396
It was probably
the same look he had

120
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,486
when he put that goddamn Glock
in his mouth

121
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:30,880
and he squeezed the trigger.

122
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:41,456
Last night I did
what I had to do. That's it.

123
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,327
Yeah. I understand that.

124
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:48,506
But you got a lot of anger
inside you...

125
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,466
and if you don't find a way
to let that shit out,

126
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:53,033
it's gonna eat you alive.

127
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,734
You're full of shit.

128
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,650
And if you don't get it out,
that shit will eat you alive.

129
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:02,825
-Mm-hm.
-Uh-huh.

00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:48,469
on the big boy,
aka Frankenstein's monster.

177
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:49,644
But you know what?

178
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:50,993
We have an unknown quantity
for you

179
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:53,474
to risk
your hard-earned cash on.

180
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,824
Today, I'm gonna give you--

181
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,217
Maxie,
what's your boy's name?

182
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,610
Oh, shit. What the hell
is your name, anyway?

183
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:01,482
-Come on, spit it out.
-No fucking way.

184
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,136
-What are you talking about?
-No fucking way.

185
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,138
Can't leave me standing here.
I bought you breakfast.

186
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,922
-Bought me fucking breakfast?
-Yeah.

187
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,054
Cheapest meal
of the fucking day.

188
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,055
No harm, no foul.

189
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:10,839
No fucking way.

190
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,755
Oh, oh. Looks like we have
ourselves a fucking pussy here.

191
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:15,191
Is that it?

192
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,933
Are you a wet fucking pussy?
You fucking coward!

193
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:23,634
You fucking coward!

194
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,988
You heard me.
You're a fucking coward.

195
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,166
You know what, guys?
If he stays,

196
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,820
I'll give you 10-to-1
on the wet pussy.

197
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,090
Do your thing.

198
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,917
You degenerate motherfuckers.

199
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,050
Go get him.

200
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:53,534
-Easy fucking money, Max.
-Uh-huh.

201
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,057
You should get
your head examined.

202
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,711
Yeah.

203
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:20,256
Yeah! Yeah! Yes!

204
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,738
-Son of a bitch.
-Yes! Yes! Ha, ha!

00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:33,008
Easy fucking money, huh?
Yeah, my ass. Pay up.

206
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,228
Come on. Thank you.

00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,367
Look at you.
Building and fixing things.

349
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,630
Well, Max said
I had to earn my keep.

350
00:25:01,674 --> 00:25:03,545
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

351
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:06,113
Oh, I fixed your sink too.
It had no pressure.

352
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:07,593
What? That's amazing, thank you.

353
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:08,898
You're welcome.

354
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:11,074
It's nice to have
some real help around here.

355
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:12,641
Oh, and I fixed
your bathroom light.

356
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:14,687
You're welcome.

357
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:17,211
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

358
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:18,386
Get-- Go in the house.

359
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,041
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

360
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:28,788
Sage.

361
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:32,618
Max Bomer.
I heard you were out.

362
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:34,576
Yeah. Made parole
about two weeks ago.

363
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:37,448
Two weeks?

364
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:39,755
-Uh-huh.
-Man, that's a long time.

365
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:43,542
I thought
we were friends, Max.

366
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:44,673
I didn't hear from you once.

367
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:46,762
You didn't call.
You didn't DM me.

368
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:49,373
I was on the road,
all right?

369
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:51,245
But I'm here now.

370
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:52,333
Yes, you are.

371
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:56,076
Where's my fucking money?

372
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:02,822
Now, look, obviously
it's not all of it.

373
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:07,609
But it's just, you know,
a good faith gesture, you know.

374
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,306
-Oh, is that it?
-Yeah.

375
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,266
That's nice.
I appreciate that.

376
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:13,833
I don't think
it's gonna cut it, though,

377
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,313
because it's like 39 short.

378
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:17,793
Thirty-nine?

379
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:20,840
No, no, no.
When I went away, it was 20.

380
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:23,712
You think the juice stopped
when you went inside?

381
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:26,410
Max, you know, they wanted

382
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:28,282
to fuck you up
when you were in there,

383
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:30,458
and I wouldn't let them,
you know why?

384
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:31,851
You're a fucking
degenerate,

385
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:33,766
but you're a degenerate
with a heart of gold,

386
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,419
who loves his family

387
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:36,638
and wouldn't want anything
to happen to them.

388
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:39,162
Don't even think about
going near my family.

389
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,295
Keep them out of it.

390
00:26:41,338 --> 00:26:43,776
Huh, this buys you one week.

391
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,171
Why don't you let me
earn it?

392
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,785
-In the ring.
-No, those days are gone, Max.

393
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:55,352
I'm not talking about me.
I got a guy.

394
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:58,312
-Huh.
-He's good. He's real good.

395
00:26:58,355 --> 00:27:01,010
Now, look, all I need
is one fight to prove it.

396
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,666
Yeah. Uh...

397
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,668
-Hey, Carter.
-Yeah, boss?

398
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:07,713
What do you say?

399
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:10,759
What's that?

400
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:12,631
Should we give
our old friend here a break?

401
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:17,200
I say you let me beat his ass,
throw him in the fucking river.

402
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:20,769
Yes. The guy's hardcore.

403
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:22,728
Come on. Look, just--

404
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:25,469
I don't know. Give me 3-to-1.

405
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:27,820
My guy against
any one of your guys.

406
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:30,474
You sure you wanna take
that kind of bet against me?

407
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:32,738
What have I got to lose?

408
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,699
You could always pick
fighters, Max.

409
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:39,875
Thank you.
Can't bet sports for shit,

410
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,225
but we wouldn't be here
if you could.

411
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:46,273
Well, all right.

412
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:50,364
I'll set you up one fight,
3-to-1.

413
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:53,628
-That's a bet.
-All right.

414
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,675
Who's this fighter
you're talking about?

415
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,808
You wouldn't know him.

His left hook
was better, though.

424
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:57,431
Ha! What you know
about boxing?

425
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,433
He taught me
a little something.

426
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:00,608
Oh, he taught you
a little something?

427
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:01,783
Yeah.

428
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,263
It's good on him
for doing that.

429
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:04,525
Yeah, well, he died.

430
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:09,660
I'm sorry to hear that.
Must have been tough for you.

431
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:13,447
Hannah, baby,

432
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,363
I need you to empty all the
trash when you come in, please.

433
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:19,366
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

434
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:26,286
-You hungry?
-I'm always hungry.

435
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:29,376
Good.
Dinner will be ready soon.

436
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:31,552
Sweet kid you got there.

437
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:33,293
Yeah, I know.

438
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:50,658
-Something smells good.
-Thanks.

439
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:52,660
Oh, I left some fresh towels
out for you.

440
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:55,054
Okay. Thanks.

441
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,970
Um-hum. You're welcome.

442
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:02,365
Thank you, really.

443
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,846
For what?

444
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,631
Taking me in.
I feel like a stray.

445
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:09,851
I always had love
for the strays.

446
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,638
Ever since I was little,
actually.

447
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:18,338
I remember there was
this cute little puppy

448
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,340
that used to run around
the neighborhood.

449
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:21,863
And I wanted to keep it
so bad,

450
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:23,865
but my dad would not
let me have it.

451
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,868
So I hid it and I fed it
for two weeks.

452
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:28,522
Did he change his mind?

453
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:30,959
No. He took it to the pound
and had it put to sleep.

454
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:33,005
-No.
-Said it was
to teach me a lesson.

455
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:35,355
-Oh, that's rough.
-It was.

456
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:37,531
-Did it?
-No.

457
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:40,403
I still got love
for the stray.

458
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:58,769
Hey.

459
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:01,729
Well, look who decided
to show up.

460
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:04,036
I missed it.

461
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,820
-Mm. You did.
-You did.

462
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,082
At the dinner table.

463
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:08,954
-I'm sorry about that.
-Uh-huh.

464
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:11,870
Since you've been gone,
Duffy fixed almost ten things.

465
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,001
At least.

466
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,437
You should have seen him.

467
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,786
He was like
Bob the Builder.

468
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,094
Well, thank you for
helping my Ra.

469
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:21,488
-Still the same old Max.
-Mm-hm.

470
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:24,491
Hannah, will you help me
do the dishes, please?

471
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:25,666
-Please?
-Yeah.

472
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:27,059
-Thank you.
-Smells good.

473
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,451
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

474
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:30,758
-It was good.
-It was great.

475
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:34,893
-That's a good family, man.
-Yeah. Yeah.

476
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:39,071
Where you been?

477
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:40,637
You wanna know
where I've been?

478
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:43,771
-Yeah.
-You sure?

479
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:44,815
Yeah.

480
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:47,949
I've been setting up
the next things.

481
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,124
-The next thing?
-Uh-huh.

482
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:51,083
Man, we haven't done
the first thing.

483
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:53,607
Listen, I talked to my guy.

484
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,044
He says he can get us in
on these next fights.

485
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:59,047
I'm talking bigger venues,
bigger money.

486
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,137
-Your guy?
-Yeah.

487
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:04,966
The next fights.
More truck-stop bullshit?

488
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,489
-No. No, Duffy listen.
-I'm not doing it.

489
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:08,927
Just listen to me for a second,
all right?

490
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:13,148
It ain't that. We talking about
real fucking money here.

491
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:14,976
Real money.

492
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,500
And like I told you before,
I know fighters.

493
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:21,113
These bums, they're not even
in your league, man.

494
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:22,897
We can take this shit.

495
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,030
We?

496
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:27,728
Yeah, we. You know,

497
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:28,903
it's a team effort.

498
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:31,688
Yeah, man, it makes sense.

499
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,821
I get punched in the face,
you get paid.

500
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,997
Hey, we all gotta do
what we gotta do.

501
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,042
Yeah, cheers.

what it takes?

519
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,007
-We'll see.
-We'll see.

520
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,575
I think we said 3-to-1,
right, Max?

521
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:16,619
Yeah.

522
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:18,708
Let's say 5-to-1.

523
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:23,104
Oh, well,
the agreement was three.

524
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:25,585
Well, it's 5-to-1
or I'm gonna walk.

525
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:27,804
This guy...
He's got balls, huh?

526
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:29,197
He's got skills
to back it.

527
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:31,808
Skills too? You got skills
to pay the bills?

528
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,160
Why don't you place the bet
and find out?

529
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,641
5-to-1?

530
00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:41,818
I'm down with it.

531
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,781
Let's go.

532
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:53,613
Yeah, yeah, okay.

533
00:34:53,656 --> 00:34:55,310
All right, all right,
all right. Yeah.

534
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:57,791
We got new faces
for you here tonight.

535
00:34:57,834 --> 00:34:59,793
No, no, no.
Trust me on this one.

536
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:01,360
I've seen both of these two,

537
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:03,318
and they're
the real fucking contenders.

538
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:05,842
You're in for
a fucking treat. Seriously.

539
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:08,193
So you know the rules.

540
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:09,933
You fight
until one of you drops.

541
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,283
There are no fucking tap-outs.

542
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:12,806
We got that?

543
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:15,156
Got it? Got it?

544
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,853
Let's fucking fight!

545
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,904
No! No!

546
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:25,123
Come on!

547
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:37,874
Yes! Let's go! Keep it going!

548
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,058

Yes! That's what the fuck
I'm trying to say.

554
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:12,779
Congratulations.

555
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,957
I fucking told you, Sage.
I fucking told you.

556
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,828
Hey, knock this win
off my principal.

557
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:20,134
Understood.

558
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,875
You made me eat my words.
What can I say?

559
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:24,225
But just give me
another chance.

560
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:27,185
-A chance for what?
-To win my money back.

561
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,405
You against Carter.

562
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:33,234
No, no, no.

563
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:34,844
What you say, cowboy?

564
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,328
He ain't no fucking cowboy.

565
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:41,764
What odds?

566
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:43,070
Hey, Duffy,
listen to me.

567
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:44,376
You don't have
to do this shit, man.

568
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,421
-Double or nothing.
-Triple.

569
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,773
It's triple or nothing,

570
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:53,080
he keeps all his money,
he walks away.

571
00:36:54,951 --> 00:36:56,388
You're a beast.

572
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:58,433
You got me feeling
all warm and fuzzy.

573
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:02,002
-You good?
-Yeah.

574
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:03,046
You got a deal.

575
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:06,006
Where and when?

576
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:07,050
Here and now.

577
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:10,880

Enough! Enough!
Come on! Hey! Hey!

586
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:52,678
Stop! Stop! Stop! You got him.
All right? All right?

587
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:55,376
You got him, man.

588
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:27,582
I gotta tell you, Duffy,

589
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:29,410
you are one
bad motherfucker, man,

590
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:31,586
but let me tell you something.
This is what I noticed.

591
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,371
You're a little flat-footed when
you're throwing your punches.

592
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:34,633
You know what I'm saying?

593
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:36,156
You need to get on
the balls of them feet,

594
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,592
generate more power that way.

595
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:39,420
-Is that right?
-I'm telling you.

596
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:40,508
Here you go.

597
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:43,946
-Lion's share.
-Wow.

598
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:55,305
Let me ask you something,
and this is real talk here.

599
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,526
Why are you in L.A.?

600
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,530
-Why am I in L.A.?
-Yeah.

601
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,146
It's a family thing.

602
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:15,325
My mother, she...

603
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,633
She died suddenly
a couple years back.

604
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:19,678
Oh.

605
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:21,984
I wasn't here.

606
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,464
Nobody was here for her.

607
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:24,900
Sorry to hear that.

608
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:28,643
So they put her
in some hole somewhere.

609
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:30,689
Alone.

610
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:36,608
Anyway, I'm gonna get her
a headstone.

611
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:41,003
I'm gonna get a piece of land
and she's gonna rest in peace.

612
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,441
That's why I'm in L.A.

613
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:47,619
Sounds like you're doing
the right thing by her.

614
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,060
Underneath it all,
you're a good dude, Duffy.

615
00:40:55,148 --> 00:40:57,019
Maybe that's why you met me.

616
00:40:58,194 --> 00:40:59,457
-Maybe.
-Maybe.

617
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:01,633
Get some rest, man.

618
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:23,568
Hello?

619
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:26,048
I got the address
to Stan's girl.

620
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:31,140
-Rachel Bomer?
-Yeah?

621
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:33,012
We're looking for
Stanley Lazare.

622
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:34,535
He's not here.

623
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,624
We're gonna have to
search your home.

624
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:38,670
Not without a warrant.

625
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:40,236
Fuck. Go.

626
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,151
-Come on.
-What the fuck are you doing?

627
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:43,457
-Don't touch me.
-Step aside.

628
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,024
What? You can't
just walk in my house.

629
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:46,460
Don't touch her!
Hannah, come here.

630
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,635
Take a seat, both of you!

631
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,681
Keep going.
Everything. Everything.

632
00:41:56,078 --> 00:41:57,558
Let's go. Tear it apart.

633
00:41:57,602 --> 00:42:00,126
The kid's room. All of it.
Fuck it.

634
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:01,519
Somebody get out there.

635
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,008
Motherfucking shit.

636
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:19,145
-Get the kid's room.
-I'll go.

637
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:25,717
All right, let's go. Let's go!

638
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:43,386
Keep looking.

639
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:57,575
What's that?
Check that fucking shit.

640
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,581
The house is clean.

641
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:08,803
Fuck.

642
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:18,683
You're a smart woman, Rachel.

643
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:21,424
And a mom.

644
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:25,385
You want what's best
for her, right?

645
00:43:25,428 --> 00:43:27,648
Hey, look at me.

646
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,825
Your boyfriend Stan...

647
00:43:33,828 --> 00:43:35,395
he's a piece of shit.

648
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:41,706
It's in your best interest
to find the money.

649
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:48,495
God, it's so fucking hard
to be a mother.

650
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:52,194
There's never enough time.

651
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:07,819
It's okay, baby.

652
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:48,250
Take it easy.

653
00:44:50,252 --> 00:44:51,776
Where's my money, Rufus?

654
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:53,560
I'm just gonna need
a little bit more time, okay?

655
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,910
-Wrong answer.
-Jesus!

656
00:44:58,391 --> 00:45:00,436
Fuck, you're making
a mess, Rufus.

657
00:45:02,438 --> 00:45:05,528
All right! All right!
Take it easy.

658
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:06,878
All right.

659
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:08,401
-Let's go! Come on.
-Okay.

660
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:10,577
Here. Take this.
It's all I got right now.

661
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,797
-What is that?
-I'm gonna have the
rest next week, okay?

662
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,798
-Next week?
-No!

663
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:15,451
Tomorrow.

664
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:17,627
Or this is gonna feel
like a fucking massage.

665
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:36,559
♪ Standin' on
The battleground, yeah ♪

667
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:44,829

668
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:47,309
No shit.

669
00:45:50,617 --> 00:45:52,575
Friends downtown
are concerned.

670
00:45:53,446 --> 00:45:55,013
That's nice.

671
00:45:55,056 --> 00:45:57,363
Their concern doesn't really
fucking help, though, does it?

672
00:45:58,581 --> 00:46:00,583
I'm just the messenger, pal.

673
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,327
Your partner
is out of control.

674
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:07,852
Her judgment is fucked.

675
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:17,992
I heard you ran into a little
trouble with one of your CIs.

676
00:46:18,036 --> 00:46:22,736
-You remember Stan Lazare?
-Yeah. That piece of shit.

677
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,347
Word is he's cleaning money
for Sage Parker.

678
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,914
Well, he was.

679
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:30,309
Until we trusted him to move
some money for an associate.

680
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:32,790
And then six figures
went missing.

681
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:33,878
What kind of associate?

682
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,403
Friends from down south.

683
00:46:39,057 --> 00:46:40,536
How much you owe?

684
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,321
Hola, Ridgway.

685
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:45,411
You've been a tough woman
to track down.

686
00:46:45,454 --> 00:46:47,892
Five hundred K.

687
00:46:47,935 --> 00:46:49,719
We got less than a week
to cover it.

688
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:54,812
Five hundred?
Friends from the south?

689
00:46:57,684 --> 00:47:01,557
-Got any accounts you can tax?
-Nothing that big, that fast.

690
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:03,646
Where does Sage come in on this?

691
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,387
It's on him too.

692
00:47:06,606 --> 00:47:08,042
I'm working on
a couple of things

693
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:09,783
to try to come up
with it.

694
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,959
Okay.

695
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:14,440
My patience is running out.

696
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:16,659
-It's handled.
-Good.

697
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:19,837
I would hate to have
to hear about you on the news.

698
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,404
Like I said, it's handled.

699
00:47:22,448 --> 00:47:25,930
I've got a crew. Six guys.

700
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:27,888
Straight fucking killers
with badges.

701
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,499
You can trust them.

702
00:47:31,936 --> 00:47:35,896
If the money's right,
we got your back.

703
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:40,031
Make that happen.

704
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:42,555
Tick-tock.

705
00:47:42,598 --> 00:47:44,252
Tick-tock.

706
00:47:58,484 --> 00:47:59,877
Oh, fuck.

707
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,487
-You okay?
-You all right?

708
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:03,576
No, I'm not okay.
Look at this place.

709
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:04,620
Holy shit.

710
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:07,797
They came in here.
They destroyed everything.

711
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:09,756
Why? What'd they say?

712
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:12,411
-They were looking for Stan.
-Stan?

713
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:13,716
What is this guy into?

714
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,457
He owned a dry cleaners.
That's all I know.

715
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:16,719
That's it?-Yes.

716
00:48:16,763 --> 00:48:17,895
What else did they say?

717
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:19,809
They said they were
looking for money.

718
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:22,900
And they asked
about somebody named Sage.

719
00:48:24,205 --> 00:48:25,554
You know somebody named Sage?

720
00:48:25,598 --> 00:48:27,121
Sage.

721
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:29,863
Max, is he
coming back here?

722
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:34,172
Is he coming back?
What do I do, Max?

723
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:35,564
Look, just, um...

724
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:36,957
You just sit tight,
all right?

725
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:38,872
Just listen to me.
Listen to me.

726
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,615
Just sit tight. Lock the door.
We'll be right back, okay?

727
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:44,878
Just lock the door.
I'll call you.

728
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,880
No cops.
Don't let anybody in.

729
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:47,925
Okay?

730
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:24,526
Yo!

731
00:49:27,094 --> 00:49:28,095
Where's Sage at?

732
00:49:32,056 --> 00:49:33,057
I wouldn't.

733
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:40,803
He's in the office, man.

734
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,678
Come on, man.

735
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:52,772
-Hey. What the fuck?
-What the fuck?

736
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:55,035
You send the cops to my house
and rough up my family?

737
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:57,951
-No, I didn't do shit.
-That's bullshit.

738
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,910
They fucked up my house.
They roughed up my sister!

739
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:02,825
-What are you talking about?
-They threatened her!

740
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,958
No, that ain't me.

741
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,960
But I do know
Stan still owes a lot of money

742
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,180
to people much more
dangerous than I am.

743
00:50:09,223 --> 00:50:12,705
If you wanna mess with them,
go on, go on ahead.

744
00:50:12,748 --> 00:50:14,924
But it went missing
from your sister's house, Max.

745
00:50:14,968 --> 00:50:16,839
If you're not
responsible for it,

746
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:18,711
who do you think
will be?

747
00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:19,973
Listen to me,

748
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,062
just keep your people
away from my family.

749
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:26,806
All right, well, I'll call off
the dogs, if you pay the debt.

750
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:32,203
-And you come fight for me.
-Never gonna happen.

751
00:50:32,246 --> 00:50:34,553
All right, I'll give you
48 hours to decide.

752
00:50:34,596 --> 00:50:38,557
After that, the outcome's
beyond my control, believe me.

753
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,907
Sage, you know what?
Fuck this.

754
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,561
Oh, Max, come on.

755
00:50:42,604 --> 00:50:44,171
We're friends.
I love you, man.

756
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:46,304
You want another shot
at the title, big man?

757
00:50:46,347 --> 00:50:47,479
You got lucky.

758
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:51,222
-You got this, baby.
-Yeah.

759
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:03,930
Hello.

760
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:06,019
Do I know you?

761
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:08,630
I know you.

762
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:17,944
Call me if you want
to level up.

763
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:20,164
Level up?

764
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:23,993
What the fuck?

765
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:26,779
What kind of cops
do you got here?

766
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,792
Goddamn it.

767
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:41,881
What the fuck
is going on here?

768
00:51:41,924 --> 00:51:44,231
I don't know, man, but
these are bad fucking cops.

769
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:47,060
Your sister's
in trouble, Max.

770
00:51:49,454 --> 00:51:50,803
Hey, I--

771
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:52,631
I appreciate
everything,

772
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:54,023
but you don't have to
do this, all right?

773
00:51:54,067 --> 00:51:55,329
This is my fight.

774
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:00,595
This is our fight.

775
00:52:03,032 --> 00:52:04,251
It's our fight.

776
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,211
Come on.

777
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:40,809
-What the fuck you doing here?
-I need a fight, ASAP.

778
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:44,422
Yeah, well,
you better keep looking.

779
00:52:44,465 --> 00:52:47,686
Fosco. What you got
for me, man?

780
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:52,778
You're not a good person
to be seen with right now, Max.

781
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:55,346
Sage will hand me my ass
just for talking to you.

782
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:56,869
He wants payback.

783
00:52:56,912 --> 00:52:59,350
Yeah, and I'm trying to get
him that payback.

784
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:01,003
So what is he,
all of a sudden

785
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:03,223
hurting to put fists
in the ring?

786
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:04,224
Come on, man.

787
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:05,356
Between you and I,

788
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:07,836
we both know
he's not the only one

789
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,360
putting on fights
in this town.

790
00:53:12,754 --> 00:53:13,929
What about that lady?

791
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,107
You really wanna go there?

792
00:53:21,415 --> 00:53:22,416
Okay.

793
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:24,853
I'll see what I can do.

794
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:30,337
-I owe you one.
-I'll remember you said that.

795
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:51,358
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

796
00:53:52,794 --> 00:53:54,753
Can you breathe?
Can you breathe?

797
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:56,972
Put this in the wound.
Put this in the wound.

798
00:53:58,496 --> 00:54:00,802
Breathe.

799
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:02,413
You're gonna walk out of here.

800
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:04,328
Look at me.
You're gonna walk out of here.

801
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:06,808
Duffy, keep the pressure on him.
I'll lift him forward.

802
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:08,767
It's gonna fucking hurt.
Are you ready?

803
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,900
-Three, two, one, go.
-Fuck!

804
00:54:11,944 --> 00:54:13,424
Okay. Okay.

805
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:16,165
-I want you to stay calm. Relax.
-All right. All right.

806
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:18,298
-It's nothing.
-We're gonna go out of here.

807
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:19,473
Huh.

808
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:22,128
We're gonna take him
out of here.

809
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:24,870
Yeah. We're gonna get you
out of here.

810
00:54:24,913 --> 00:54:26,306
Yeah.

811
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,351
Ford?

812
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:30,484
We got you, buddy.

813
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,967
-We got you, old boy.
-Hey, hey.

814
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:37,970
Shit.

815
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:42,191
-We gotta go. We gotta go.
-Goddamn it.

816
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:44,368
We gotta get him
back to his family, Duff.

817
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:46,935
We gotta get him back
to his fucking family, okay?

818
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:51,984
Come on. Come on.
Up!

819
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:31,240
Hey.

820
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:36,115
Can't sleep either, huh?

821
00:55:36,158 --> 00:55:39,074
-No. Did I wake you?
-No. No.

822
00:55:40,075 --> 00:55:42,034
I'm up all night.

823
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:45,037
That Hannah, that girl can
sleep through an earthquake.

824
00:55:46,299 --> 00:55:48,040
-You're fine.
-Okay, good.

825
00:55:52,174 --> 00:55:55,352
Thank you. For everything.

826
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:57,919
Fixing the house.

827
00:55:59,094 --> 00:56:00,226
I appreciate you.

828
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:02,489
You're welcome.

829
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,103
So tell me about you.

830
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,455
What was it like
being in the military?

831
00:56:13,587 --> 00:56:15,284
It was all right at first.

832
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,331
I was really young
when I joined.

833
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,202
I was gonna
change the world.

834
00:56:20,246 --> 00:56:21,421
Really?

835
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:23,902
Yeah.
Till the world changed me.

836
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:26,470
How so?

837
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,603
Well, I mean,

838
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:31,562
I saw some bad things,
you know.

839
00:56:31,605 --> 00:56:34,913
You don't see the worst
parts of humanity

840
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:36,523
over and over and over again

841
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:39,178
and not be affected,
not be screwed up.

842
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:43,487
I'm sorry.

843
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:45,967
Yeah.

844
00:56:46,011 --> 00:56:47,534
I lost
a lot of good friends.

845
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:49,971
A lot of good brothers.

846
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:54,149
I see their faces every night
when I close my eyes.

847
00:56:54,193 --> 00:56:56,891
Every, every single night.

848
00:56:59,372 --> 00:57:00,460
I can't escape it.

849
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,942
That's why I keep moving.

850
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:07,902
So...

851
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:10,992
That's my sad story.

852
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:19,610
It's not that sad.

853
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,453
Come on.

854
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,022
What can I do for you, Fosco?

855
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:45,331
The question is,
what can I do for you?

856
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:48,029
Well,
I'm seriously intrigued.

857
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:50,641
-Duffy.
-What about him?

858
00:57:54,209 --> 00:57:55,776
You want to know
the shit about him?

859
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,125
Well, uh--

860
00:57:57,169 --> 00:57:58,300
Word on the street is...

861
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,521
he's put a major dent
in your payroll

862
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:04,089
and he's made you look
like a fool.

863
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:11,226
You think I look like
a fool, Fosco?

864
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,446
Well, would I be here
if I did?

865
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:15,666
Right.

866
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:18,495
Max is desperate
for another fight.

867
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:20,018
He wants high stakes.

868
00:58:24,718 --> 00:58:27,547
Fine. Fuck it.
Let's give him what he wants.

869
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:29,897

What do you know
about this guy?

Well, he's slower than you,
there's no doubt about that.

896
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:25,257
The guy you're about to fight
is a fucking cop.

897
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,780
What?

898
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:30,567

All right.

I should handcuff you
to that fucking pole behind me.

901
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:38,618
Well, as much as I like
the sound of that,

902
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,533
if you're talking about
Stan the Man,

903
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,100
the guy's a piece of shit.

904
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:44,798
He was skimming.
He paid for it. He's gone.

905
00:59:44,842 --> 00:59:48,541
I don't think you really
understand. The house was clean.

906
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,152
It's on you.

907
00:59:51,196 --> 00:59:52,850
Oh, no, no, no.

908
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:55,287
This is on both of us,
detective.

909
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:57,768
If you're thinking about
coming down on me hard,

910
00:59:57,811 --> 00:59:59,770
I'll only come down
on you harder.

911
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:06,167
Twenty-year decorated LAPD
detective Ellen Ridgway...

912
01:00:06,211 --> 01:00:09,475
with dope and money
and the gangs and cartels.

913
01:00:09,518 --> 01:00:12,739
That sounds like
some front-page shit to me.

914
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:14,088
I got the pics.

915
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,571
High resolution and
everything.

916
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:21,879
Are you ready tonight?

917
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:26,840
Are you fucking ready tonight
for a fight?

918
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:29,843
Fighters.

919
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:36,502
The rules are
there no rules.

920
01:00:38,286 --> 01:00:41,550
Tonight, these gladiators
are fighting for blood.

921
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,597
They're fighting for respect.

922
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,514
They're fighting for you.

923
01:00:50,385 --> 01:00:53,650
So let's fucking fight!

924
01:00:57,523 --> 01:00:58,524
Let's go Duff.

925
01:01:00,178 --> 01:01:01,658
Let's go! Come on, come on.

926
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:05,618
Watch out!
Come on. Come on.

927
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:10,275
Come on, let's go.

928
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:12,712
Yes!

929
01:01:13,582 --> 01:01:14,758
Bullshit!

930
01:01:15,193 --> 01:01:16,194
Oh shit!

931
01:01:21,634 --> 01:01:22,635
-Come on.
-Come on!

932
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:34,734
Yes! Yes!

933
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:44,352
It's all good. Yes!

934
01:01:44,396 --> 01:01:45,397
Yes!

935
01:01:47,442 --> 01:01:49,357
-Yes!
-We got a winner!

936
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:51,620
Winner!

937
01:02:14,513 --> 01:02:16,428
Shit. What the fuck
just happened?

938
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:17,777
What the fuck just happened?

939
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:19,605
Your boy just killed
a fucking cop.

940
01:02:19,648 --> 01:02:21,302
That's what the fuck
just happened.

941
01:02:27,439 --> 01:02:28,788
LAPD!

942
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:31,312
Everyone clear
the fucking place out now!

943
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:33,837
Get the fuck out!

944
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:39,407
I'm getting my ass
out of fucking town

945
01:02:39,451 --> 01:02:40,887
before Ridgway
finds me,

946
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:44,717
because she'll want your beating
heart on a fucking plate.

947
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,545
Let's go.

948
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:47,807
Get the hell out of here.

949
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:49,956
Santiago was undercover.

950
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:54,613
Gang-related killing.
Put that in the report.

951
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:02,099
He was a good fucking cop.

952
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:04,449
He was one of us.

953
01:04:04,492 --> 01:04:06,886
Sage is
blackmailing us.

954
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,409
Says he has
pictures of us

955
01:04:08,453 --> 01:04:09,933
coming out of
the O'Sullivan case.

956
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:12,500
Then
fuck him too.

957
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:16,678
Just make sure nothing
comes back to haunt us.

958
01:04:23,076 --> 01:04:24,077
Okay.

959
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,529
Shit, Mom,
you could have knocked.

960
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:44,402
You start paying rent,
then I'll start knocking.

961
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:48,754
-You wanna explain this to me?
-Shit.

962
01:04:48,797 --> 01:04:50,582
"Shit"?

963
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:54,760
Hannah, what is this doing
in our house?

964
01:04:54,803 --> 01:04:57,067
Ask that piece of shit
that you're dating.

965
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:58,546
Excuse me?

966
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:59,983
You know it's true.

967
01:05:00,026 --> 01:05:01,941
I mean, he is.

968
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,769
Look at the way
that he treats you.

969
01:05:03,812 --> 01:05:06,076
He had this money in the house,
knowing that we need it,

970
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:08,034
and that we're always behind,
always struggling.

971
01:05:08,078 --> 01:05:09,166
Hannah.

972
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:10,645
And he just forgot
that it was there

973
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:12,430
because he's high
all the time.

974
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:14,127
I hate him!

975
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:15,694
I hate that you're with him.

976
01:05:15,737 --> 01:05:17,435
I hate
the way that he treats you.

977
01:05:17,478 --> 01:05:19,916
I hate that he acts that way
towards you.

978
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:22,092
-You don't deserve that.
-Okay, baby.

979
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:26,009
-I was just trying to help.
-I know. I know. It's okay.

980
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,750
I'm sorry.

981
01:05:28,794 --> 01:05:31,101
I didn't mean for those cops
to mess up the house.

982
01:05:31,144 --> 01:05:32,276
Baby, look at me.
Look, wait.

983
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:33,930
I didn't want anyone
to get hurt.

984
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:36,976
-It is not your fault.
-I'm sorry.

985
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:37,977
It's my fault.

986
01:05:41,763 --> 01:05:43,635
-I love you.
-I love you.

987
01:05:43,678 --> 01:05:44,636
It's okay.

988
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:52,644
-Max?
-Listen to me.

989
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:54,689
I need you to pack
some things right now.

990
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:57,127
Be ready in 15 minutes.
We're almost there.

991
01:05:57,170 --> 01:06:00,130
-What are you talking about?
-I'll explain when we get there.

992
01:06:00,173 --> 01:06:01,566
Wait, Max, listen.

993
01:06:03,176 --> 01:06:04,612
We found the money.

994
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:08,747
Well, you might as well
keep it. You're gonna need it.

995
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,619
Just be ready to leave
as soon as we get there.

996
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:14,013
All right, bye. Pack up.
We gotta go.

997
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,710
-What?
-Pack up. Come on, let's go.

998
01:06:15,754 --> 01:06:16,755
Mom!

999
01:07:28,305 --> 01:07:32,222
It's Kincaid. Shots fired.
Wabash and Fourth.

1000
01:07:32,265 --> 01:07:35,616
Armed suspect on the premises.
Send backup.

1001
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:42,275
Go, go, go!

1002
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:43,276
What the fuck is going on?

1003
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,712
In the car.

1004
01:07:44,756 --> 01:07:46,236
-Hannah, let's go.
-Come on. Move!

1005
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:49,761
Rachel, come on! Get in the
goddamn car. We gotta go now!

1006
01:07:49,804 --> 01:07:51,719
What is going on, Max?

1007
01:07:52,981 --> 01:07:54,157
Down!

1008
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:06,865
-Mom!
-Call 911!

1009
01:08:06,908 --> 01:08:09,215
All right. Come on. Call 911!

1010
01:08:09,259 --> 01:08:12,610
-All right, all right.
Look at me.
-Fuck, fuck me.

1011
01:08:12,653 --> 01:08:16,875
Look at me, Hannah. You're okay,
baby. You're okay. Look at me.

1012
01:08:16,918 --> 01:08:19,747
Yeah, listen.
My niece has been shot.

1013
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:22,141
Just send someone
the hell down here right now.

1014
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:25,666
B-O-M-E-R.
Yes. Hannah Bomer.

1015
01:08:27,015 --> 01:08:29,757
I'm her uncle.
Just hurry the hell up.

1016
01:08:29,801 --> 01:08:32,151
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1017
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:33,370
-How far?
-Just hang on.

1018
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:34,849
They're just
two minutes out. Okay?

1019
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:37,809
The ambulance
is two minutes away, baby.

1020
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:40,333
-I don't wanna die.
-You're not gonna die, baby.

1021
01:08:40,377 --> 01:08:42,335
You're not gonna die.

1022
01:08:42,379 --> 01:08:43,989
Where the fuck are they?

1023
01:09:04,227 --> 01:09:06,142
We need to end this
tonight.

1024
01:09:11,408 --> 01:09:12,409
Let's do it.

1025
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:28,164
Let me get your phone.

1026
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:31,950
For what?

1027
01:09:33,343 --> 01:09:35,954
I'm gonna call somebody
that may be able to help us.

1028
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,222
Duff!

1029
01:10:31,923 --> 01:10:32,924
Hey.

1030
01:10:35,448 --> 01:10:37,929
Don't you fucking sneak up
on me like that.

1031
01:10:37,972 --> 01:10:39,844
-Heh, how you doing, Duff?
-How are you?

1032
01:10:42,107 --> 01:10:44,892
Look at you, mate.
Haven't changed a bit.

1033
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,766
-How you doing, mate?
-Hey.

1034
01:10:48,809 --> 01:10:50,768
That's Max.
That's who I'm talking about.

1035
01:10:50,811 --> 01:10:52,204
Max. I'm Don.
Nice to meet you.

1036
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,337
Take a seat.
You guys want a beer?

1037
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,512
-Sure.
-Yeah?

1038
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:02,910
-Fucking hell.
-How you been, man?

1039
01:11:03,998 --> 01:11:05,304
You know, getting by.

1040
01:11:06,436 --> 01:11:08,089
Look at you.

1041
01:11:08,133 --> 01:11:10,396
Look at you, man. Fuck me.

1042
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,442
-How long's it been?
-About seven years.

1043
01:11:12,485 --> 01:11:14,008
-Fuck off.
-Yeah.

1044
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:16,446
I'm not counting or anything,
but yeah.

1045
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:18,317
I tried to get
in contact with you.

1046
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:20,101
You did?

1047
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:21,320
Yeah, I did.

1048
01:11:21,364 --> 01:11:23,322
Yeah, I went through a thing,
you know.

1049
01:11:25,106 --> 01:11:26,934
Yeah. Nah.

1050
01:11:27,892 --> 01:11:29,328
It's all right, mate.

1051
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:33,245
Thank you.

1052
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:36,335
Did he fill you in on, uh,
all this guy's accomplishments

1053
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:38,511
and the legend that is
Duffy?

1054
01:11:38,555 --> 01:11:40,513
-Not a clue.
-Fucking legend.

1055
01:11:40,557 --> 01:11:42,472
Saved my ass at
least twice. Right?

1056
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:44,038
-Probably more.
-Probably.

1057
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:47,041
Yeah.
One time in Kenya.

1058
01:11:47,085 --> 01:11:50,001
Yeah, you remember that?
And then, uh...

1059
01:11:50,044 --> 01:11:51,307
Mogadishu.

1060
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:53,352
Moga-fucking-dishu. Yeah.

1061
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:56,964
Lucky to get out of that place
in one piece.

1062
01:11:57,008 --> 01:11:58,009
Maybe.

1063
01:12:01,055 --> 01:12:05,582
So, uh, ahem, you wanna tell me
what's going down?

1064
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,148
Going through the shit, man.

1065
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:11,022
His sister is--
His niece is in trouble.

1066
01:12:11,065 --> 01:12:15,505
We're dealing with
some crooked fucking cops.

1067
01:12:15,548 --> 01:12:18,377
-The worst kind.
-It's bad.

1068
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:21,554
We need guns. We need gear.
We need it tonight.

1069
01:12:22,903 --> 01:12:23,904
Well, uh...

1070
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,865
there's something in the car.

1071
01:12:27,908 --> 01:12:29,127
In the car, heh?

1072
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:30,563
Yeah, I got something
in the car.

1073
01:12:33,131 --> 01:12:34,480
I wasn't sure exactly
what you needed,

1074
01:12:34,524 --> 01:12:36,308
so I brought a few options.

1075
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,050
-Yeah, you did.
-We appreciate this.

1076
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:42,488
Hey, don't worry.
For this guy, whatever you need.

1077
01:12:42,532 --> 01:12:44,229
-Fuck.
-I owe you, brother.

1078
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:45,535
You don't owe me, mate.

1079
01:12:47,928 --> 01:12:49,626
-So when do we leave?
-We?

1080
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:53,238
You got nothing
to do with this, man.

1081
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:54,326
I fucking do now.

1082
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:56,546
This isn't your fight brother.

1083
01:12:56,589 --> 01:12:58,374
Since when was
any of the shit

1084
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:00,071
that we did over there
our fight?

1085
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:01,942
It was never
our fucking fight, was it?

1086
01:13:02,987 --> 01:13:04,467
Right now, I got a mate

1087
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,120
who needs my fucking help.

1088
01:13:06,164 --> 01:13:08,471
So whether you like it or not,
I'm coming with you.

1089
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,911
Besides, I'm bored
out of my fucking mind.

1090
01:13:38,196 --> 01:13:39,676
They're here.

1091
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:41,417
Green means go.

1092
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,941
My lead, through the front.
Riggs, through the back.

1093
01:13:43,984 --> 01:13:45,246
Remember,
no arrests tonight,

1094
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,640
no paperwork.
Toe tags for everyone.

1095
01:13:53,733 --> 01:13:55,692
-Hey! Hey!
-Where is he? Where is he?

1096
01:13:57,084 --> 01:13:58,956
-Where is he? Where is he?
-Fuck you.

1097
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:02,176
-Where is he?
-Where's Sage? Sage!

1098
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,569
We had a fucking deal. I fight,

1099
01:14:03,613 --> 01:14:05,310
you leave his family alone.

1100
01:14:05,353 --> 01:14:07,007
And I did. What the fuck
you talking about?

1101
01:14:07,051 --> 01:14:08,052
The drive-by.

1102
01:14:09,357 --> 01:14:11,621
The drive-by at my house,
you fucking asshole.

1103
01:14:11,664 --> 01:14:13,405
-They shot my niece!
-I didn't do--

1104
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,451
What you think this
shit is funny, huh?

1105
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:24,982
It's Ridgway.

1106
01:14:25,678 --> 01:14:27,332
-Fuck her.
-Where is she?

1107
01:14:27,854 --> 01:14:29,073
Where is she?

1108
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:31,292
-Ridgway's a cop.
-I don't give a fuck.

1109
01:14:31,336 --> 01:14:33,730
Santiago was a cop.
She's cleaning up loose ends.

1110
01:14:33,773 --> 01:14:35,122
We're all fucked.

1111
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:40,204
Light them up!

1112
01:16:57,743 --> 01:16:58,788
Max?

1113
01:17:13,193 --> 01:17:14,368
Baby!

1114
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:22,507
-Are you okay?
-I love you, Lynx.

1115
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,204
Baby, are you okay?

1116
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:35,868
I didn't do shit.

1117
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:38,697
I know you didn't do shit.

1118
01:17:43,006 --> 01:17:44,007
Max!

1119
01:17:45,835 --> 01:17:46,836
You good?

1120
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,708
-Max!
-Drop the fucking gun

1121
01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:51,318
or I'll shoot him
in the head.

1122
01:17:51,362 --> 01:17:53,886
-Fuck.
-Drop the fucking gun!

1123
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,409
All right, all right.

1124
01:17:56,497 --> 01:17:57,673
All right.

1125
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:05,898
How are you gonna
get out of this?

1126
01:18:09,293 --> 01:18:10,424
It's what I do, Duffy.

1127
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,343
It's too bad Sage fucked up.

1128
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:19,869
We could have had some fun.

1129
01:18:19,912 --> 01:18:20,913
Fuck off.

1130
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:37,625
-You good?
-Yeah, yeah.

1131
01:18:38,844 --> 01:18:40,846
Ugh... Fuck!

1132
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:43,457
Am I dying?

1133
01:18:55,382 --> 01:18:56,383
I can't...

1134
01:19:07,394 --> 01:19:08,744
-Come on.
-All right. Yeah.

1135
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:13,574
-Let me see.
-Fuck.

1136
01:19:15,838 --> 01:19:18,928
The goddamn thing
actually works. Huh!

1137
01:19:21,408 --> 01:19:22,409
Oh, fuck.

1138
01:19:25,673 --> 01:19:27,850
You're all right.
You are all right, man.

1139
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:29,808
Sorry, brother.

1140
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:31,636
I'm sorry, brother.

1141
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,203
You got nothing to be
sorry about.

1142
01:19:34,987 --> 01:19:37,468
All right. All right.

1143
01:19:37,511 --> 01:19:40,645
All right. Look at me.
Walk you out of here.

1144
01:19:40,688 --> 01:19:41,777
-Duff?
-Yeah.

1145
01:19:47,608 --> 01:19:49,610
I'm gonna walk you out of here.

1146
01:19:49,654 --> 01:19:51,656
I'll walk you out of here.

1147
01:19:51,699 --> 01:19:52,788
-Duff?
-Yeah.

1148
01:19:57,009 --> 01:19:58,271
I missed you, man.

1149
01:20:00,883 --> 01:20:01,971
I missed you.

1150
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:04,930
I missed you too.

1151
01:20:24,732 --> 01:20:26,082
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

1152
01:20:27,387 --> 01:20:28,519
You okay?

1153
01:20:28,562 --> 01:20:31,609
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
-Okay, good.

1154
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:36,005
Hey, Duff, come on, man.
We gotta go.

1155
01:20:36,048 --> 01:20:37,528
Go, man. You go.
Get out of here.

1156
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:38,703
No.

1157
01:20:39,922 --> 01:20:42,054
Listen to me.
We go together.

1158
01:20:43,577 --> 01:20:45,405
That's it.
Together.

1159
01:20:51,063 --> 01:20:52,717
Okay.

1160
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:53,761
All right.

1161
01:21:09,038 --> 01:21:10,387
Morning, John.

1162
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:11,823
We are live
here in downtown,

1163
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,694
where last night
police are saying

1164
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:15,392
a massive shootout took place

1165
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:18,569
between local law enforcement
and drug traffickers.

1166
01:21:18,612 --> 01:21:20,397
At least ten are dead,

1167
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,879
including veteran detectives
Ray Kincaid and Ellen Ridgway,

1168
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:26,055
who tragically lost their lives
in the line of duty.

1169
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:28,753
Ridgway was
a highly decorated officer,

1170
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:30,581
who,
according to the department,

1171
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,931
served her district
with passion and honor.

1172
01:21:32,975 --> 01:21:34,672
And her loss will leave a void

1173
01:21:34,715 --> 01:21:37,022
in the community she served
for years to come.

1174
01:22:57,146 --> 01:22:59,104
Hey Rachel, it's Duff.

1175
01:22:59,713 --> 01:23:01,715
Look, I just wanted to
say thank you.

1176
01:23:02,586 --> 01:23:04,588
Looking out for me, you know,
taking in a stranger.

1177
01:23:04,631 --> 01:23:05,850
I appreciate it.

1178
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:10,681
Sorry I won't be there for
Hannah when she wakes up but...

1179
01:23:13,205 --> 01:23:15,599
She is strong, like her momma.

1180
01:23:16,643 --> 01:23:17,949
She'll be fine.

1181
01:23:21,126 --> 01:23:22,954
Anyway, I got to take
off for a while.

1182
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,477
Till this whole thing dies down.

1183
01:23:24,521 --> 01:23:26,871
You know cops,
they look out for cops.

1184
01:23:27,524 --> 01:23:28,742
Good or bad.

1185
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:33,356
As for the money...

1186
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:38,187
I took what I needed for a
proper headstone for my mom.

1187
01:23:39,492 --> 01:23:41,668
Somewhere, I know she's
gonna be happy.

1188
01:23:44,976 --> 01:23:46,412
Keep the rest for you guys.

1189
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,635
Keep Max out of trouble.

1190
01:23:54,116 --> 01:23:55,508
He's a good man.

1191
01:23:56,857 --> 01:23:58,772
Keep that spare room ready,
okay?

1192
01:23:59,121 --> 01:24:01,558
You never know when I might
pop in to see you guys.

1193
01:24:02,646 --> 01:24:04,082
I'll see you again.

1194
01:24:05,214 --> 01:24:06,389
